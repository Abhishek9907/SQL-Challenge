-- Question 15
-- The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. 
-- Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- | Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
-- | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
-- | 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
-- | 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
-- +----+-------+--------+-----------+
-- Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. 
-- For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

-- Create Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    NAME VARCHAR(255),
    Salary INT,
    ManagerId INT
);

-- Insert data into Employee table
INSERT INTO Employee (Id, NAME, Salary, ManagerId) VALUES
    (1, 'Joe', 70000, 3),
    (2, 'Henry', 80000, 4),
    (3, 'Sam', 60000, NULL),
    (4, 'Max', 90000, NULL);


-- Solution
SELECT e.name FROM Employee AS e
INNER JOIN Employee AS m
ON e.`ManagerId`=m.`Id`
AND e.`Salary`>m.`Salary`
